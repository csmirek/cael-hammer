This project is built to eventually be a java based desktop application.  The point of the project is to create a system by which any user can create strong passwords without the task of having to remember inane combinations of random letters, numbers, and characters.  Instead the system requires a handful of inputs that are hopefully easier for people to remember and allow for a level of randomization on par with completely random passwords.
